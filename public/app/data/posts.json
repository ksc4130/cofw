And so are the women who write them. Love Between the Covers is a feature-length film chronicling the vast, funny, and savvy female community of romance writing. Emmy award-winning Director/Producer Laurie Kahn followed the lives of five diverse and successful romance authors (and one unpublished newbie) as they built their businesses, found and lost loved ones, coped with a tsunami of change in publishing, and earned a living doing what they love--while empowering others to do the same.</p><blockquote>\"I think that it shows that women are important. Women’s feelings, thoughts, and desires are important.\"</blockquote><p>Pulling back the covers on a billion dollar industry, this film documents romance authors who are on the front lines, pioneering new ways to survive and building communities in our rapidly changing environment.</p><p>Many institutions and individuals have supported this project: the National Endowment for the Humanities, Mass Humanities, the Nora Roberts Foundation, Romance Writers of America, Amazon.com, Harlequin Enterprises, the Tavris Fund at Brandeis University, and donations through the website, lovebetweenthecovers.com.</p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwABHUXofhY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><br>"

Together, they play off each another to amplify the page-turning effect.  But it can be challenging to blend the two without falling into the traps of having a cookie-cutter and too-obvious mystery or ill-timed and unrealistic love scenes.</p><p>When romantic suspense is done well, the two elements are so intertwined that you can’t pull one out without destroying the flow of the book.  But how do you combine them, still hit your word count, and keep both the suspense and the romance strong, believable and unique?</p><p>Join critically acclaimed and award-winning author ELIZABETH HEITER as she discusses how to put the suspense in your romantic suspense. Elizabeth writes two series: her psychological suspense with romantic elements for MIRA Books, The Profiler series (whose heroine was called “one of the most amazing characters created in print” by Fresh Fiction) and her romantic suspense series for Harlequin Intrigue, The Lawmen series (the latest of which won RT’s Reviewers’ Choice Award for Best Intrigue).

Or at least I was. I'm a recovering procrastinator now, but you can't become one of those until you do a few things.</p><p>What are they?</p><ul><li>Realize what is taking up so much of your time</li><li>Clarify whether it really is procrastination or something else</li> <li>Decide to do something about it, deciding what is important and what isn't as important and what doesn't even rate the designation of being considered important</li><li>Weed out impossible dreams from attainable goals</li></ul> <p>A short list? In some ways. But look at it another way. Are you accomplishing anything? Or as much as you want to? If the answer is &quot;ummmm, well,..&quot; it's time to take control. It's not like you want a bushel basket full of &quot;if onlys&quot; rather than an avalanche of true accomplishments, is it? Procrastination is made up of what sometimes feels like a zillion things interfering with any chance of you attaining your dreams. On July 9th, I'll help you start down the path to recovery from chronic procrastination, or even from a mild case of it.</p><p>Beth Daniels hails from Ohio (the Dayton area) and wears many hats. As Beth Henderson she writes romantic comedy, historical romantic adventure, and romantic suspense. As Beth Cruise she wrote for the old Saved By The Bell series spinning YA romantic comedy. As J.B. Dane she writes mystery and fantasy, and as Nied Darnell she steps into Steampunk. Under her real name she writes non-fiction books about writing fiction or writing college essays. Those books sprung from her years of teaching English Comp at the college level and from the over 60 different workshops she has presented online through various RWA Online Chapters and other online workshop groups. Currently she’s at work on a historical romantic mystery, the 2nd book in an urban fantasy series, and polishing the first tome of a Steampunk trilogy. She has a BA in History and an MA in English Composition and Rhetoric with an Emphasis in Creative Writing, and a less official PhD in Procrastination. That last means she's had to REALLY put her mind to besting procrastination...at least when it comes to writing.
