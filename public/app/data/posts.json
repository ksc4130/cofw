And so are the women who write them. Love Between the Covers is a feature-length film chronicling the vast, funny, and savvy female community of romance writing. Emmy award-winning Director/Producer Laurie Kahn followed the lives of five diverse and successful romance authors (and one unpublished newbie) as they built their businesses, found and lost loved ones, coped with a tsunami of change in publishing, and earned a living doing what they love--while empowering others to do the same.</p><blockquote>\"I think that it shows that women are important. Women’s feelings, thoughts, and desires are important.\"</blockquote><p>Pulling back the covers on a billion dollar industry, this film documents romance authors who are on the front lines, pioneering new ways to survive and building communities in our rapidly changing environment.</p><p>Many institutions and individuals have supported this project: the National Endowment for the Humanities, Mass Humanities, the Nora Roberts Foundation, Romance Writers of America, Amazon.com, Harlequin Enterprises, the Tavris Fund at Brandeis University, and donations through the website, lovebetweenthecovers.com.</p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwABHUXofhY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><br>"
