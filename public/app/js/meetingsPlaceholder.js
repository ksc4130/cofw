So in a story, heroism requires more than being perfectly heroic, and even more than committing heroic acts. It also requires the ability to change under pressure, to grow into someone better even if it hurts.</p><p>In the same way, creating a heroic character requires more of the author than merely creating a perfectly brave protagonist and inventing exciting events to showcase those powers and skills. It requires providing the protagonist the need to change, the courage to change, the opportunity to change, and the motivation to change.</p><p>The imperfect protagonist makes the three-dimensional story possible. The character moving through the external plot is a story of only two dimensions. The internal journey, the process towards psychological or emotional or life change, provides the depth that takes this story into three dimensions.</p><p>In this interactive workshop, we'll explore how you can determine your own character's heroic flaw, and use it to develop a meaningful opening, a powerful journey, and a dramatic and satisfying ending.</p><p>Emotion Without Purple Prose</p><p>In this interactive workshop, bestselling author Alicia Rasley helps you explore two “non-purple-prose” ways of creating a compelling emotional experience for readers: Story Design and Scene Design. Interactive exercises focus on your story as you move beyond plotting into presentation, as Alicia provides helpful feedback aimed at helping you find and create the emotion. You’ll leave with some seriously useful (but easily applied) strategies to deepen your story and scenes, and you’ll have a chance to ask Alicia for advice on your own work. In this friendly and conversational workshop, you’ll learn:<ul><li>Shaping the entire plot to create emotion in the reader</li><li>Arranging story events to tighten, focus and maximize drama</li><li>Going beyond just describing emotion to actually induce emotion</li><li>Using scene design, body language, and “magic rule of three”</li><li>Creating emotion without purple language or overwriting</li></ul><p>Bio: Alicia Rasley lives in Regency England-- well, no. She just writes about it! She lives in the American midwest, surrounded by books about Regency England. Her Regency romances have won several awards, including the prestigious RITA for Best Regency Romance. She has also written women's fiction, mystery, and non-fiction books. She teaches writing online and at a state university, hoping to instill the love of commas into today's college students.</p>"
