But you do not need a completed manuscript to enter the contest and be considered for the first, second or third prize in your respective category. See Entry information below.</p>-->
                        <!--<p><strong>Contest Description:</strong> Our contest is named Ignite the Flame for a reason. We want to lose ourselves in the one scene of your unpublished manuscript when your hero and heroine first meet (or reunite after a period of time) and experience that first spark of attraction, that irresistible heat drawing them together. So kindle that fire—show us your first meeting, the surprise reunion, an awkward introduction or the unforgettable moment of initial awareness. Thrill us with the promise of what is to come. We want to be there when they experience the first stirrings of attraction for one another. Tease us with a little flicker that is destined to become an inferno. The Ignite, the Flame Contest, is designed to help you polish that critical first meet scene so that it crackles with romantic energy! ***Note: This is not a first kiss or first sex scene contest***</p>-->
                        <!--<p><strong>Entry:</strong> On-line entries only. Submit up to15 pages (15 page maximum), double-spaced, with manuscript’s title, genre and page number in the upper left-hand header. If your Igniting the Flame scene is not in the first chapter of your manuscript, please include a set-up for the judge. Set-up and entry are to be submitted as one file. The set-up will not be critiqued or affect your submission score. </p>-->
